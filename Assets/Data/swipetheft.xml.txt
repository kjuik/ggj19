            <you>-…so, is this your first swipe date?</you>
            <they>Yeah. Not even sure why I signed up. To be honest, I’m just here cause some frat boys are throwing a party at my dorm and I’m not feeling like getting puked on.</they>
            <you>Glad to be your distraction. I’ll try my best to entertain.</you>
